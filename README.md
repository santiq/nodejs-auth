# Node.js Authentication

Implementation of node.js authentication with social login ✌️, user impersonation 💅, and no passport.js required 💁

This is the example repository from the blog post ['🛑 You don't need passport.js - Guide to node.js authentication ✌️'](https://softwareontheroad.com/nodejs-jwt-authentication-oauth?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme)

Please read the blog post in order to have a good understanding of the server architecture.


## Development

We use `node` version `10.15.0`

```
nvm install 10.15.0
```

```
nvm use 10.15.0
```

The first time, you will need to run

```
npm install
```

Then just start the server with 

```
npm run start
```
It uses nodemon for livereloading :peace-fingers:
